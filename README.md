HELLO THERE! I don't know how did you get here, but let me introduce myself.

My name is Earl and I'm an incoming Computer Science student this August 11 (this is written on August 8, 2025). 
I'm using this repository to compile my projects.

It is named portfolio as I'm looking forward to use this for job application. :) Feel free to browse this repository if you want.
